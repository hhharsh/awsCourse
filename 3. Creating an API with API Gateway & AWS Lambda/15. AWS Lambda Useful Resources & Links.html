<p>Just as with AWS API Gateway, we'll look into Lambda together. Maybe you still want to browse the docs whilst following along or dive deeper into Lambda after finishing this section. This is just a "Getting Started" course after all.</p><p>The following links should be helpful:</p><p>- AWS Lambda Overview: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" rel="nofollow">https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/</a></p><p>- AWS Lambda Developer Documentation: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html</a></p><p>And of course, <strong>don't forget to think about the pricing</strong>!</p><p>Lambda charges you for executing code AND the duration each execution takes. There's a generous free tier available though.</p><p>More details about Lambda pricing: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/" rel="nofollow">https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/</a></p>
