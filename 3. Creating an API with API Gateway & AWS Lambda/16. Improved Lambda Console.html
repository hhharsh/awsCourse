<p>AWS enhanced the Lambda console but no worries, it still works as taught in the course.</p><p>The features haven't changed, the setup process and UI just got modernized and easy no a bit easier to use.</p><p>Here's how to create a function:</p><p>1) Click <strong>"Create function"</strong></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-04-12_12-18-51-bab08a2c6708d87e804a64360ff95b6e.png"></figure><p>2)<strong> Leave the default selection</strong> (=&gt; "<strong>Author from scratch</strong>")</p><p>3) Choose "<strong>Create a new role from template(s)</strong>" and enter <strong>any role name of your choice</strong>. You <strong>don't need to select anything in the "Policy templates" dropdown</strong>! Leave it empty.</p><p>4) Click "<strong>Create function</strong>"</p><p>Thereafter, you'll be in the Lambda editor UI where you can write code, attach triggers (as shown in the next video =&gt; We won't attach any here) and where you can edit the general Lambda config. Some items maybe be re-positioned (compared to the video) but the general functionality is 100% the same.</p><p>5) Additionally, your Lambda function might have the <code>async</code>  keyword added to it. <strong>Remove it</strong> to ensure that the code works as shown in this course!</p><p>-------------</p><p>The new console is cleaner and more powerful, writing code and testing it has become easier. I strongly recommend watching the following presentation video created by AWS where they introduce the new console and editor: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMyniSCOJdA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMyniSCOJdA</a></p><p>The new Lambda console/ editor part starts at 10:02: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMyniSCOJdA?t=10m2s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/pMyniSCOJdA?t=10m2s</a><br></p>
