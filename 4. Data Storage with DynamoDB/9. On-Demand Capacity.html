<p>Since December 2018, DynamoDB also offers a new option regarding the provisioning of read &amp; write capacities: The <strong>On-demand mode</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-12-12_09-46-50-49e0b705bab29951915e21c7a25b8d2e.png"></figure><p>This mode is great if you have no idea about how much read and write capacity you will need.
