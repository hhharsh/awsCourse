<p>In the last lecture and in an earlier lecture, we optimized the permissions. It's <strong>best practice</strong> to only grant the minimum amount of permissions a service requires.<br></p><p>We <strong>left out one optional permission</strong> though: The permission to <strong>create logs</strong>.</p><p>If you do want your Lambda functions to create logs (in CloudWatch), make sure to adjust the <strong>"Roles"</strong> we created.</p><p>For that, visit <strong>IAM =&gt; Roles</strong> and <strong>select the roles</strong> you created for Lambda. Make sure to add a new policy by clicking <strong>"Attach Policy"</strong>. Then, filter for "Lambda" and choose the <strong>"AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"</strong> which will give Lambda the base permissions it requires for writing logs to CloudWatch.</p>
