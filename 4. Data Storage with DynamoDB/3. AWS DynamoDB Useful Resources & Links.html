<p>As always, we'll have a closer look at DynamoDB in this module. But in case that you want to read along or dive deeper into some of the concepts I touch on, the following links should be very helpful:</p><p>- Overview over DynamoDB: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" rel="nofollow">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/</a></p><p>- Developer Documenation: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html</a></p><p>And, as always - <strong>don't forget to check what it costs</strong>! It's mostly about provisioned capacity units, more info can be found in the pricing article: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/" rel="nofollow">https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/</a></p>
