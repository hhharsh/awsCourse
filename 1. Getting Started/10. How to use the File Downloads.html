<p>In this course, I provide the API we create and the code we write for download (the API as a definition file). Typically, the files for a module <strong>are attached to the last lecture of that module</strong>!</p>



<h4>API Definition Files:</h4>



<p>API Snapshots are provided as .json definition files (using Swagger + API Gateway Extensions). You can <strong>import them directly in API Gateway</strong>. Simply create a new API and choose <strong>"Import from Swagger"</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>BEFORE IMPORTING:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Replace</strong> the <strong>REGION</strong> placeholder (in the .json file) with the <strong>region where your Lambda functions are stored</strong>, <strong>replace</strong> the <strong>ACCOUNT_ID</strong> placeholder with <strong>your account id</strong>. Your <strong>Lambda function names have to match mine</strong>, otherwise you have to adjust these names in the .json files, too!</p>



<h4>AWS Lambda ZIP Files:</h4>



<p>All Lambda code is provided as ZIP files. You can easily use these by <strong>creating a new function</strong> (with "blank" template) and <strong>choosing "Upload a .ZIP file"</strong> from the <strong>"Code entry type" dropdown</strong>.</p>
